This repository contains an Rdata dataset containing betting lines and performance ratings for matchups between two FBS football teams between 2016 and 2018. It also contains a crosswalk between team names from Collegefootballdata.com and Footballoutsiders.com, which is where the betting lines and performance data were taken from, respectively. Due to formatting issues, there are a few FBS teams not included in the Rdata dataset. 

For my own reference, it also contains a template for web scraping that I used to get the Footballoutsiders.com FEI data into a usable format.
